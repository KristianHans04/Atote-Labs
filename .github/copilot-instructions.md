1. Security Best Practices

- **MANDATORY** security measures for every feature:
    - **SQL Injection Prevention:** Use parameterized queries, never string concatenation.
    - **XSS Protection:** Sanitize all user input and escape output.
    - **CSRF Protection:** Implement anti-CSRF tokens in all forms and API requests.
    - **Rate Limiting:** Enforce limits on login (e.g., 5/min) and API access (e.g., 100/hour).
    - **DDoS Protection:** Use request throttling, firewalls, and CAPTCHA for public endpoints.
    - **Input Validation:** Whitelist allowed parameters and enforce data formats.
    - **Authentication:** Secure sessions and account lockout after repeated failures.
    - **Authorization:** Always check user permissions before granting access.
    - **File Upload Security:** Validate file types, scan for malware, and restrict file sizes.
    - **Dependency Security:** Regularly audit dependencies for vulnerabilities.
    - **Content Security Policy (CSP):** Apply strict CSP headers.
    - **Secure Headers:** Implement strict HTTP security headers.
    - **API Security:** Use token-based authentication (e.g., JWT) with expiration and refresh tokens.
    - **Password Security:** Hash and salt all credentials securely.
    - **Sensitive Data Logging:** Exclude sensitive fields from logs.
    - **Session Security:** Set cookies with `secure`, `httpOnly`, and `sameSite` attributes.
    - **Directory Traversal Protection:** Sanitize and validate file paths.
    - **Mass Assignment Protection:** Explicitly control allowed data inputs.
    - **Information Disclosure Prevention:** Use custom error pages; no stack traces in production.
    - **Clickjacking Protection:** Use `X-Frame-Options` or `frame-ancestors` headers.

2. API Keys & Secrets Management

- **NEVER** commit API keys or secrets to repositories.
- Use environment variables or secure key management systems.
- Rotate keys regularly.
- Use separate keys for development, staging, and production.
- Implement least-privilege access (e.g., read-only vs. write).
- Encrypt secrets at rest and in transit.

3. Database Protection – NEVER DESTROY DATA

- **NEVER** run destructive database commands such as:
    - Dropping the database.
    - Resetting the database.
    - Reloading schema.
    - Any command that causes data loss.
- **ONLY** use safe migrations or schema updates.
- **ALWAYS** backup before major changes.
- **NEVER** truncate or delete production data.
- If data needs cleanup, use soft deletes or archiving strategies.

4. Testing & CI/CD Requirements – MANDATORY

- **MUST** write comprehensive tests for all code:
    - Unit tests for core logic and utilities.
    - Integration tests for APIs and components.
    - Functional tests for user workflows.
    - Security tests for authentication and authorization.
    - Performance tests for critical features.
- **Test Coverage Requirements:**
    - Minimum 80% overall test coverage.
    - 100% for payment and security-critical code.
- Write tests before or alongside implementation.
- **CI/CD Pipeline MUST PASS:**
    - All tests must pass before merging.
    - Code linting and style checks must pass.
    - Security scans for dependencies must pass.
    - Database migrations must be reversible.

5. Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA) Best Practices

- **Prioritize Efficiency:** Always consider the time and space complexity of your algorithms. Strive for optimal solutions.
- **Big O Notation:** Understand and use Big O notation to analyze and compare the efficiency of different approaches.
- **Data Structure Selection:** Choose data structures that fit the problem. For example:
    - Use `HashMap` (or `dict` in Python) for fast lookups (O(1) on average).
    - Use `Array` for ordered data with fast index-based access.
    - Use `Set` for storing unique elements and fast membership testing.
    - Use `Queue` for FIFO (First-In, First-Out) processing.
    - Use `Stack` for LIFO (Last-In, First-Out) processing.
- **Algorithm Optimization:**
    - Avoid nested loops that can lead to O(n^2) or worse complexity if a more optimal algorithm exists.
    - Consider trade-offs between time and space complexity. Sometimes, using more memory can lead to a faster algorithm.
    - Use sorting and searching algorithms efficiently.
- **Code Reviews:** During code reviews, pay close attention to the efficiency of the implemented algorithms and data structures.

6. Code Organization & Modern Practices

- **JavaScript or Frontend Code:**
    - Use modular architecture (imports/exports).
    - Follow ES6+ syntax and best practices.
    - Avoid inline scripts.
- **CSS/Styling:**
    - Use utility-first or modular CSS approaches.
    - Keep styles organized by component or feature.
    - Avoid inline styles unless necessary.
- **HTML/Templates:**
    - Use reusable components or partials.
    - No business logic in templates.
    - No emojis in any view.
- **Services/Modules:**
    - Follow the Single Responsibility Principle.
    - Keep clear and well-defined public interfaces.

7. Documentation Best Practices

- All documentation belongs in a dedicated `docs/` directory.
- Never place documentation files in the project root.
- **Recommended structure:**
    - `docs/` – Main documentation directory.
    - `docs/api/` – API documentation.
    - `docs/guides/` – Development guides.
    - `docs/architecture/` – System architecture documents.
- Architecture details should be stored in `docs/PROJECT_ARCHITECTURE.md`.
- **Temporary documentation** (like project summaries, quick references) should be placed in `temp_docs/` folder which must be added to `.gitignore`.

8. Global Website Requirements

- This is a global website — not specific to any country or region.
- **DO NOT** use region-specific references:
    - Avoid local currencies — support USD or multi-currency.
    - Avoid regional statistics, demographics, or examples.
    - Avoid country-specific phone number formats or addresses as defaults.
- **MUST** support international usage:
    - Multiple currencies with USD as primary.
    - International phone number formats.
    - Global time zones.
    - Multi-language support.
    - International payment gateways.
- Use neutral, global examples and references.

9. Mobile Responsiveness

- Every UI component must be mobile-first and responsive.
- Use responsive design techniques or frameworks.
- Test at viewport widths: 320px, 768px, 1024px, 1440px.
- Ensure touch targets are at least 44x44px.
- Use responsive images (`srcset`, `sizes`) and adaptive layouts.

10. Accessibility Requirements

- Minimum WCAG 2.1 Level AA compliance.
- **Images:** Provide descriptive `alt` text.
- **Forms:**
    - Use labels for inputs.
    - Display clear error messages.
    - Support keyboard navigation and focus states.
- **ARIA Labels:** Use when necessary for non-semantic elements.
- **Color Contrast:** Minimum 4.5:1 for normal text.
- **Keyboard Navigation:** Ensure all interactive elements are accessible.
- **Screen Reader Support:** Test with screen reader software.
- **Skip Links:** Include “Skip to main content” link.
- **Language Attribute:** Set correct `lang` on the `<html>` element.
- **Focus Management:** Maintain logical tab order and visible focus states.
- **Headings:** Maintain proper hierarchy (no skipped levels).

11. Theme Support (Light/Dark Mode)

- All UI components must support both light and dark themes.
- Use CSS variables for colors (e.g., `--color-primary`, `--color-bg`).
- Implement theme switching via a global attribute (e.g., `data-theme`).
- Store user preference in local storage or database.
- Ensure consistent appearance across all components.

12. SEO Optimization (Target: 95%+ Lighthouse Score)

- **Meta Tags:** Unique `<title>` and `<description>` for every page.
- **Semantic HTML:** Proper heading hierarchy, use of `<article>`, `<nav>`, `<main>`.

- **Robots.txt:** Properly configured for search indexing.
- **Canonical URLs:** Set to prevent duplicate content.

13. No Emojis Policy

- **ABSOLUTELY NO EMOJIS** in any part of the application.
- This applies to:
    - User interfaces, templates, components.
    - Database seeds and sample data.
    - Emails and notifications.
    - Error and success messages.
    - Forms, labels, and placeholders.
    - Console or log messages.
    - API responses and documentation.
    - SEO content and metadata.
- Use clear, professional text only.
- Use SVG or font-based icons, not emoji characters.
